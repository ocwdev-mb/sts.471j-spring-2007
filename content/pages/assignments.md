## Book Report

Read one of the books on the approved course list and write a 3-5 page review. Write-up should include critical examination of book and its sources, and discussion of topic's relevance to the larger Apollo project. Review should also discuss an engineering decision discussed in the book and what factors came into play when making that decision. Due in class just after spring break.

## Final Team Projects

These projects are, essentially, subsystem analysis and redesign of what happened in the Apollo program. Work includes the detailed study of a single subsystem, discussing specifications, engineering choices, performance, and problems. Redesign should use today's technology, materials, and management techniques in support of the CEV program, using lessons derived from Apollo. The final products are a written report and a class presentation.
